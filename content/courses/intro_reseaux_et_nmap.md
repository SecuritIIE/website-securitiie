This presentation focused primarily on introducing the basics of networks to people with no prior knowledge in this field, in order to introduce the NMap tool.  
Important network concepts were simplified and explained using analogies to make the nmap explanations easier to understand.   
Students were introduced to concepts such as the OSI model, IPv4 addresses, ports and more.  
They finally tried to solve a challenge by using nmap to shh to a vulnerable target, and find the flag!
