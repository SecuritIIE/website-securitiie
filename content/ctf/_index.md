> In the end of 2024, The board organised a CTF event, in collaboration with the cybersecurity association of [APU](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forensic-security-research-center-student-section-apu/).

With more than 200 players, this event was a really formative experience. It allowed us to show out our technical skills by making all kind of challenges, of various levels of difficulty.

You can find the challenges on our [github page](https://github.com/SecuritIIE/public_solves_ctf2024).

Thanks to APU for undertaking this project with us !
