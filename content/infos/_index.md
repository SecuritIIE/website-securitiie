SecuritIIE is the cybersecurity association of [ENSIIE](https://www.ensiie.fr/). Our goal is to share knowledge in our school, through courses and CTF competitions (Capture The Flag).

This website regroups some of the courses (in french) given by the association, tools, guides and documentation about cybersecurity ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It's purpose is mainly to learn good habits and to make everyone progress in our common passion.

Goodwill is a must, concerning how we treat eachother and learn together. This is why we want to remind you that it is your responsibility to use what you learn in our association in a good manner, and that you expose yourself to the law if you defy the rules.
